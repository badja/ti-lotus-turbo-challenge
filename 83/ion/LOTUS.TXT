About
=====
Lotus Turbo Challenge is a fast-paced racing game presented from a second-
person 3D perspective. You must complete each course while racing against the
clock and avoiding opponent cars. There are six courses, each with different
scenery and climatic effects.


How to Play
===========
At the title screen, press the 2ND key to play the selected course. Initially
you will only be able to play course 1.

The next screen introduces the course. Hold down 2ND now, so that you'll
accelerate as soon as the game starts. Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to
steer. You can slow down a bit by releasing 2ND, or brake using ALPHA.

The horizontal line at the top of the screen shows how much time you have
left. At each checkpoint your time will be boosted. At the end of each course,
any remaining time will be added to your score. You will then progress to the
next course.

You don't have to start at course 1 if you have reached a later course. You
can select which course to start at on the title screen, but your score will
start at zero.
